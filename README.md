This project parses and compares Substrate Weight files. It helps tremendously with the review process of large Weight diffs. The results can be displayed conveniently in the CLI or browser.

# Abstract

Manually comparing Substrate Weight files is a task where humans falter and computers excel.  
When you want to know what I am talking about; take a look at [this diff](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5098/files).  
Now tell me which lines are problematic and which are fine ðŸ˜ˆ? Does not look appealing, does it? 

This is where *SWC* comes to the rescue: It takes the old and the new version and compares all extrinsics.  
The human-friendly output looks like this:  

![](.assets/compare%20mr%20output.png)

This automatically sorts the worst offenders to the top and allows humans to see at a glance what is going on â€“ without loosing details! Links to the diff are all there, and sharing results is as easy as copying a link to the line. Compatible with most Substrate chains. Enjoy!

You can play around with the following public endpoints that are exposed by `swc-web`:  
- [Compare Merge Requests](https://weights.tasty.limo/compare-mr)
- [Compare Commits](https://weights.tasty.limo/compare-commit)

The *dev* branch is deployed at <https://weights.tasty.limo:8443/>.

# Install

Install both binaries:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/ggwpez/substrate-weight-compare swc swc_web

swc --version
swc-web --version
```

# Compilation

The [rust-toolchain.toml](./rust-toolchain.toml) defines the exact Rust version that the code was tested with.  
The formatting rules are defined in [rustfmt.toml](./rustfmt.toml).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggwpez/substrate-weight-compare

cd substrate-weight-compare/
cargo build --profile production
```
# Example: Web Interface

Assuming you have a Substrate compatible repository checked out in the parent directory:

```sh
swc-web --root ../ --repos polkadot substrate cumulus
```

then open your browser and try the following:
- [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

# Example: Compare weight files

Suppose you have some weight files in:
- `OLD=repos/polkadot/` and
- `NEW=my_other_repos/polkadot`   
The base command looks like this:

```sh
swc compare files --old $OLD/* --new $NEW/* --method worst
```

If you want to compare the weights of the Kusama to the Polkadot runtime, the command becomes a bit more longer:
```sh
swc compare files --old ../polkadot/runtime/kusama/**/weights/*.rs --new ../polkadot/runtime/polkadot/*/weights/*.rs --method worst --ignore-errors --change changed unchanged --unit time --threshold 10
```

```sh

Cou can use the `--print-terms` flag to print the terms. This example omits them since the rows get really long.


# Example: Compare Polkadot Commits

Compare arbitrary Polkadot commits assuming that you have checked the repo out:

```sh
FROM=20467ccea1ae
TO=ef922a7110eb
THRESHOLD=30

# Compare the commits
swc compare commits $FROM $TO --threshold $THRESHOLD --repo ../polkadot

pallet_scheduler.rs::on_initialize_named_aborted 4957 -> 3406 ns (-31.29 %)
pallet_election_provider_multi_phase.rs::finalize_signed_phase_reject_solution 33389 -> 19348 ns (-42.05 %)
pallet_election_provider_multi_phase.rs::submit 77368 -> 42754 ns (-44.74 %)
pallet_election_provider_multi_phase.rs::on_initialize_nothing 23878 -> 12324 ns (-48.39 %)

pallet_scheduler.rs::on_initialize_periodic_resolved 33 -> 0 ns (-100.00 %)
frame_benchmarking_baseline.rs::subtraction 100 -> 131 ns (+31.00 %)
frame_benchmarking_baseline.rs::addition 96 -> 126 ns (+31.25 %)
pallet_scheduler.rs::on_initialize_periodic 5139 -> 7913 ns (+53.98 %)
runtime_common_crowdloan.rs::on_initialize 0 -> 4293 ns (+100.00 %)
```
It prints first the ones that decreased (good) and then the ones that increased (bad) sorted by ascending absolute value.

# Config options

## Repository

Selects the project to use. *SWC* has the goal of being compatible with:
- [Substrate]
- [Polkadot]
- [Cumulus]

Other projects which are currently compatible, but not a hard requirement:
- [Moonbeam]
- [Composable Finance]

Note: Not all repositories are deployed to the *SWC* web service.

## Path Pattern

Uses the [glob](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/) crate to match files in the repository path with the given pattern.  
Here are some examples that the web interface uses. These do not catch *all* files, which is a bug:  
- Substrate: `frame/*/src/weights.rs`
- Polkadot: `runtime/*/src/weights/**/*.rs`
- Cumulus: `**/weights/**/*.rs`

`weights/**/*.rs` is preferred to `weights/*.rs` to include possible sub-folders like XCM.  
The `mod.rs` file is automatically excluded.  

## Pallet

Filter by the pallets to include by using a [Regex].  
Examples:
- `.*` would be *any* pallet.
- `system|assets` would be the `system` and the `assets` pallet.
- `

## Extrinsic

Analogous to the [Pallet](#pallet) filter this filters by the extrinsics using a [Regex].  
Examples:
- `.*` would be *any* extrinsic.
- `mint|burn` would be the `mint` and the `burn` extrinsics.

## Evaluation Method

The evaluation method defines how the weight equation is evaluate (=calculated).  
This is a deciding factor when making a decision whether or not a weight got worse.

- *Base*: Only consider the constant factor of the weight plus storage operations.
- *Exact Worst*: Assumes both equations to be hyper-planes and finds their greatest relative increase by evaluating all corners. The runtime for `n` components is `2^n` which is hard-limited to 16 components.   
This requires your weight files to support component range annotations. One way to check that is to search for the string `"The range of component"` in your weight.rs files.
- *Guess Worst*: Tries to apply *Exact Worst* but assumes all components to have a maximum of 100, if no maximum was found. This is a best-effort approach in case your weight files do not have [component range annotations](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/11397).

NOTE: The storage weights are currently set to RocksDB Substrate default.  
## Rel Threshold

Filters the changes results by an absolute percentual threshold.  
The percentages values are calculated as increase or decrease.  
Eg: from 100 to 150 would be +50% and would be included by any threshold >=50.

## Abs Threshold

Filters the changes results by an absolute threshold.

## Unit

Controls the unit of the output. Can be set to:
- Weight: Raw weight numbers (default).
- Time: Time each extrinsic took.

## Ignore Errors

Silently ignore parse errors. This is useful when using inclusive path patterns.

## Git Pull

Pull the branch before comparing anything. This ensures that you are on the last commit.  
This does not override the *Cache*. It can therefore take up to 10 minutes for a new change to show up.

## Cache

The web UI caches success responses for 10 minutes. Currently there is no flag to disable it.  
Use commit hashes instead of tags and branches if you need uncached results.

# Running the Tests

There exist *unit* and *integration* tests. Most of them are guarded behind feature flags. The explanation below covers both in one.

## Integration tests

Integration tests do currently not exist for all supported repos (see [integration.rs]).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggwpez/substrate-weight-compare
cd substrate-weight-compare

# Clone all the test-able repos
mkdir -p repos
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/ repos/polkadot
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/ repos/substrate
git clone https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/ repos/moonbeam
git clone https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/ repos/composable

# Run ALL the tests
cargo test --release --all-targets --all-features
```
